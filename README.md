## Task

Calculate volume of figures: Cylinder, Cuboid, Pyramid (with different bases)

## Usage

2 alternative solutions are proposed:

1) The volume-alt.js package that requires standalone classes for all the figures and implements the Factory Method pattern

To run:

```node app-alt.js```

To test:

```node --test test-alt.js```

2) A deprecated solution - the volume.js package that does not require standalone classes for all the figures

To run:

```node app.js```

To test:

```node --test test.js```


To test both solutions:

```node --test```

## Details

All pyramid bases are implemented.

Tests are implemented with the ```node:test``` module.
